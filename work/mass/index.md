<h1>Mass</h1>
<p>2018 · Iron and resin · 120 cm</p>

<p>
  <em>Mass</em> contemplates the weight of belief—its physical and spiritual gravity. Formed from iron cutouts of a cathedral resting on human feet, the work fuses architecture and body, faith and structure. Created in Iran, the choice of a church rather than a mosque underscores the universality of organized religion and its capacity to both elevate and confine.
</p>

<p>
  The title <em>Mass</em> refers simultaneously to the religious ritual and to the notion of mass as weight, suggesting that faith, while transcendent, is also something borne and carried.
