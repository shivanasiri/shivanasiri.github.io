<h1>The Distance Between Two</h1>
<p>2015 · Fiberglass, iron · 70 × 75 cm</p>

<p>
  <em>The Distance Between Two</em> (<span style="font-family: monospace;">d = √((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)</span>)  
  transforms a mathematical expression of separation into a reflection on emotional and existential distance. The formula for the space between two points becomes a metaphor: a reminder that even when bodies appear close, their inner worlds may remain unreachable.
</p>

<p>
  The human form emerges as a shell—present but partially withdrawn—suggesting that we reveal only fragments of ourselves to one another. The work quietly questions the limits of understanding and intimacy: can we ever truly bridge the distance between two beings when even the self remains partly unknown?
