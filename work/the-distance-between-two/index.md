  <em>The distance between two</em> (<code>d = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)</code>) 
  explores spatial tension and measurement as a metaphor for emotional and physical separation. 
  The interplay of fiberglass and iron evokes both fragility and permanence, 
  blurring the boundaries between scientific abstraction and human connection.
