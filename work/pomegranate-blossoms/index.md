<p><em>Pomegranate Blossoms</em> is created in memory of the passengers of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, many of whom were students traveling from Iran to Canada. Using pomegranate blossoms—a symbol of life, vitality, and cultural continuity—the piece reflects on a tragedy marked by loss, denial, and the weight of unacknowledged grief. The handcrafted forms, made from iron, aluminum, wool yarn, and papier-mâché, evoke fragility held within a metallic shell. <em>Pomegranate Blossoms</em> stands as a quiet act of remembrance, honoring lives cut short and the futures they carried, while acknowledging the collective trauma that followed.</p>
