<p><em>The Quiet After</em> reflects on connection, interdependence, and the altered rhythms of human interaction during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two cocoon-like forms sit side by side, each emerging only partially—one offering legs, the other hands—suggesting that neither figure is complete without the presence of the other. Their quiet movement toward one another evokes a fragile return to touch after a period of isolation. Influenced by Saadi Shirazi’s verse, “The children of Adam are limbs of one another,” the work considers how resilience and becoming are shaped through shared vulnerability. <em>The Quiet After</em> holds the moment between separation and reunion, where the impulse to reach out slowly reawakens.</p>
