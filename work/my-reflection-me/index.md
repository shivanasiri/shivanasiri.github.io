<p><em>My Reflection (Me)</em> is created in memory of the students injured in the 2012 Shin Abad school fire in Iran. 
Suspended fiberglass faces hover above the ground, while molten, burn-like forms spread across the floor—echoing both physical trauma 
and the lingering imprint of an event that was never fully addressed. The work reflects on the survivors’ transition into adulthood, 
many still carrying visible scars and unmet medical needs despite years of promises. The piece becomes a meditation on vulnerability 
and the absence of institutional care, holding space for the psychological weight borne by those whose bodies and futures were irrevocably altered.</p>
