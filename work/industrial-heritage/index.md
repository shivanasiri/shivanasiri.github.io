<h1>Industrial Heritage</h1>
<p>2020 · Resin, epoxy, iron · 43 × 50 × 15 cm</p>

<p>
  <em>Industrial Heritage</em> reflects on environmental degradation and the altered bodies that emerge from industrial impact. Combining resin, epoxy, and iron, the figures appear part-organic, part-manufactured—creatures reshaped by the very systems they inhabit. Their forms evoke mutation, fragility, and adaptation, suggesting that pollution in the air, water, and food slowly redefines what it means to be human.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Industrial Heritage</em> positions the body as both witness and product of ecological damage, proposing a future in which our physical identities bear the imprint of the environments we have created.
